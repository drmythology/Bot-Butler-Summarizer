<!-- GPT-3 Simple App -->

This web app runs with the help of the GPT-3 model API with focus in summarization. The code is written with the help of 
a boilerplate cloned repository [https://github.com/nextgrid/GPT-3-Nextjs-Tailwind-starter].
I refactored the code to fit the new [text-davinci-003] model and edited some of the UI,
added some comments, and deleted previous snippets of code that does not work anymore.

Summarize this for a second-grade student:

Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two-and-a-half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. Jupiter is one of the brightest objects visible to the naked eye in the night sky, and has been known to ancient civilizations since before recorded history. It is named after the Roman god Jupiter.[19] When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can be bright enough for its reflected light to cast visible shadows,[20] and is on average the third-brightest natural object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus.

[output:] 
Jupiter is a very bright planet in the night sky. It is the fifth planet from the Sun and is the biggest planet in the Solar System. It is named after the Roman god Jupiter and was known by ancient civilizations. It is so bright that its light can cast shadows!
